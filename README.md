# StormGraphs

Welcome to the repository for the analytical work on my Master's thesis at Kent State University under the advisement of Dr. Elizabeth Herndon. It is my hope that this repo will form the basis for graphing in the Herndon lab group as well as provide the code for my graphs once we submit my thesis for publication.
